# AskGenie-AI
AskGenie AI is my latest project — an AI-powered Question Answering app that understands your context and delivers accurate answers instantly.

This project showcases:

💬 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

🧠 Fine-tuned Transformer models

⚙️ Streamlit for interactive UI

☁️ Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces

I trained the QA model using a custom SQuAD-style dataset covering domains like finance, health, and education, and deployed the app so anyone can explore the power of contextual question answering.

🧞 Overview: What is AskGenie AI?
AskGenie AI is an intelligent question-answering web app designed to provide accurate, context-based answers using advanced natural language processing. Powered by transformer-based models and custom-trained datasets, the app allows users to input a question and a relevant context, and then generates precise answers within seconds.

Whether you're exploring information from documents, articles, or domain-specific texts (like finance, health, or education), AskGenie AI acts like your smart assistant — ready to answer with clarity and speed.
